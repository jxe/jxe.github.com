					<h2>Your tour</h2>
					Welcome to your Valentine's day tour! 
					Get your stuff together, walk out of Joe's house, and then swipe over to the next slide.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Beginning</h2>
					The tour actually begins at the bridge that goes from Joe's house to Leuchtstoff. It's called <a target="_" href="https://goo.gl/maps/6QT43bo6bau2qCvGA">Hertabrücke.</a> Walk to that bridge now. Here's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/55bFnrLvc4tUvHVngYhMV3?si=3ujIwzrzRjSTuqhxuHAMiw" target="_">some music</a> to accompany you. Go to the next slide when you get to the start of sidewalk along the bridge.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>At the bridge</h2>
					You assignment as you cross the bridge is super simple. Just walk across the bridge while listening to <a target="_" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1q8NdCAQ9QUjpYiqzdd3mv?si=lW0lfFGfS1uIxx5Sf8fpDQ">this song</a>, and add a little hip shake to your walk. It can be super subtle. No one would even notice that you're walking different than you normally do. But shake your hips a little more like a sexy spanish girl.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Walking to Leuchtstoff</h2>
					You can keep walking with the hip shake or normally, as you like. If you want a new song, try <a target="_" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4EBisBBehGON4ESJsNZBsP?si=MoOjJQyxTpe1WZea4qkvAw">this one</a>. When you enter Leuchtstoff, swipe to the next slide.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>In Leuchtstoff</h2>
					Great! I love this place. Your first assignment is to find a place to sit with a table or desk. You need a surface on which you could write or draw. You can share with someone if you need to. Or if you can only find a chair without such a surface, see if you can find a book you can use as a surface. When you're ready, swipe on.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Sitting in Leuchtstoff, pt 1a</h2>
					You'll have two assignments here in Leuchtstoff. Each will take about 10 minutes, so 20 minutes in total. We're about to begin the first. To begin it, first get out your paper and pen, and put the paper on the surface. Now, you need to close your eyes and listen to <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/0c0ZVPQPNOfoW16dSa891N?si=cykPbaNjTYise7OA-nWGkQ' target='_'>this song</a>. With your eyes closed, try to get in touch with the UNIVERSE. You are the servant of the universe. You feel what it wants. It's voice is within you. Swipe when the song is done and you are in touch with what the UNIVERSE wants.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Sitting in Leuchtstoff, pt 1b</h2>
					Great. Your next task is to make a little performance, on paper, for the UNIVERSE. You're going to be drawing on paper, but think of it more like your hands, and the pen, and your body, is dancing. And this is a performance for the UNIVERSE. Do the best you can, while listening to <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/3QpN3dazIcMNqru0L1qLMt?si=AoSO6nSBRee3IveQFYPjVA' target='_'>this song</a>.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Sitting in Leuchtstoff, pt 1c</h2>
					How did you do? Do you think the UNIVERSE appreciated your performance? Do you think the UNIVERSE would consider you a BOSS? If not, you'll get another chance.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Sitting in Leuchtstoff, pt 2</h2>
					Okay. One more assignment before leaving Leuchtstoff. You're going to listen to <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/0RxznT4d9yj4Uc70jYC95k?si=IIgZa4OtTeOKTzVwMC5Y0w' target='_'>this song</a> and look around at the people here. Look at them lovingly. When you've got that going on -- the song and the loving looks, swipe on.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Sitting in Leuchtstoff, pt 2b</h2>
					Now just ask yourself, for each person you can see, what you would lovingly ask them to do. What I mean is--if you had their best interest at heart and were going to give them a task, an immediate task to do right now, that you think might help them... what would it be? Come up with such tasks for at least three people.
				</section>
				<section>
				   <h2>Sitting in Leuchtstoff, pt 2c</h2>
				   You are about to leave Leuchtstoff, but if you feel like it, you could suggest one of your tasks to one of the people. Be brave if you feel like it. In any case, leave Leuchtstoff and walk down to the S-Bahn. 
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Getting on the Ring-Bahn (West)</h2>
					You'll be going West, towards the Tempelhof stop. Here's a <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/5WUxLqUKQdEZ5oW3uZiSni?si=pWAZUnhXSyey19L_-hciew' target='_'>song</a> while you wait. Swipe when you're on the train.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>On the Ring-Bahn</h2>
					Time for another hip shake! Here's your <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/7BlBVFwvbWvcwNcUarQmjk?si=pZoZ6UyTRs2I2vw-7GoYJA' target='_'>dose of reggaeton</a>. Be subtle if you want. Or go crazy! Get off at  Tempelhof.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>At S-Bahn Tempelhofer Feld</h2>
					Walk down to the Feld. Try to find a spot on the Feld where you won't be watched. A spot where you can try some dance moves without feeling too shy. Here's <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/4vS5pFdTc072tP25kRqmWy?si=xaTMN40UTqq44zzHnzTgvg' target='_'>a song</a> for your walk.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>On the Feld, pt 1</h2>
					Okay, Joe should have whatsapped you a video explaining a contact improv exercise earlier. It starts by swinging your arms around. You're going to do that exercise now, while <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/3L45cLjU7ts5FdQoJrZzQU?si=E0XlZyMJSN6DNd-U65RkSg' target='_'>this song</a> plays.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>On the Feld, pt 2</h2>
					Now that you're warmed up, you've got one more task here. It's another performance for the UNIVERSE. This time with your whole body. No one is watching except the UNIVERSE. Give it your best shot for a few minutes while <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/4nYWjyefCKTCjpOqhqxqDZ?si=SjoRd2BlS2y8HIiwJf09PQ' target='_'>this</a> plays.   
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>On the Feld, pt 2b</h2>
					How did you do? Do you think the UNIVERSE appreciated your performance? Do you think the UNIVERSE would consider you a BOSS? If not, you'll get another chance.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Getting on the U6 (North)</h2>
					Okay, back to transit. Go to the u6 platform to head north to Französische Str. Here's a <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/2UZXQrEi0A8ySbDuyeuMt3?si=IZK6E-beQsmRV8oDArxEDA' target='_'>song</a> for your cooldown and walk. And swipe when you're on the u6.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>On the u6</h2>
					Back to <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/0RxznT4d9yj4Uc70jYC95k?si=IIgZa4OtTeOKTzVwMC5Y0w' target='_'>this song</a>. Here on the u6, ask yourself, again, for each person you can see, what you would lovingly ask them to do. Come up with tasks for at least three people.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Still on the u6?</h2>
					If you still have time on the u6, take a break. Otherwise swipe on when you get off at Französische.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>At U6 Französische</h2>
					Your next task is to walk to the <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/Pwkonuq4TZTLXPvS6' target='_'>Humbolt University Library</a>. Here's a <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/6MjiDmDF6Qvy7FPSwzHSaQ?si=O2VVz88MTH2bUC0g1lvmsg' target='_'>song for you on the way</a>, but I also have a meditation for you to do while listening to the song. Swipe for it once the song is going.
				</section>
				<section>
				   <h2>Meditation while walking to library</h2>
				   ASK YOURSELF: Do you feel more like doing something embodied, heart-centered, or intellectual? Do you feel like doing something wild, or constrained? Think of three embodied things you could do. Think of three heart-centered things. Think of three intellectual things. Think of three wild things. Now, again: Do you feel more like doing something embodied, heart-centered, or intellectual? Do you feel like doing something wild, or constrained?
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>The Lobby of the Library</h2>
					Time for another hip shake! Here's your next <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/0Q7ZM15J0cJA9rd7pQYdRq?si=wUOfrFMOTjOR-IhOo_6QmA' target='_'>dose of reggaeton</a>. Be subtle if you want. Or go crazy! You can stay in the lobby while the song plays or dance your way up to the 3. OG / Bereich B.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Choosing a book</h2>
					Go to the 6770 section on the 3. OG floor, section B. See if you can find a book that interests you. When you've got one, grab it to carry with you, and swipe. (Here's <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/6ZQ3XvLBrmwnoNFtU0c2X5?si=Q4Jclrt0S1KE_u06Bmuneg' target='_'>music</a> for choosing a book if you want.)
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Walking to the Study Area</h2>
					Okay, on the same floor you're on, near you, is a study area where people sit at desks and read. It's in the giant atrium at the center of the library. Go there and find a desk towards the front. Make sure to stay on the same floor and the same side of the library. When you're seated, with your book, swipe on.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Sitting at the Study Area, pt 1</h2>
					(<a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/44MqpNL8xdtG3hTT2QWbQ4?si=VEbWhBFGTUWpcSwGaJv1uw' target='_'>Music</a>) ASK YOURSELF: Do you feel more like doing something embodied, heart-centered, or intellectual? Dso you feel like doing something wild, or constrained? Think of three embodied things you could do. Think of three heart-centered things. Think of three intellectual things. Think of three wild things. Now, again: Do you feel more like doing something embodied, heart-centered, or intellectual? Do you feel like doing something wild, or constrained?
				</section>
				<section>
				   <h2>Sitting at the Study Area, pt 1b</h2>
					If you feel like reading, read. If you feel like doing something embodied or heart centered, do that. Ask yourself every two minutes to make sure you're doing what you like.
					When you get bored of this question, swipe on.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Sitting at the Study Area, pt 2</h2>
					Are you really ready to go on? Swipe only if you are really ready.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Sitting at the Study Area, pt 2b</h2>
					Look across the atrium, and see Joe on the other side. Queue up <a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/2Pe3DE10mmweK5TLEZVTtg?si=-s9Scu-WQqesIt1rWY2aew' target='_'>this song</a> but don't press play. Then swipe right.
				</section>
				<section>
				   <h2>Sitting at the Study Area, pt 2c</h2>
					Use your fingers to signal counting down from 5 to Joe on the other side. When you get to zero, you will both press play. Then swipe right.
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Sitting at the Study Area, pt 2d</h2>
					 You're going to have a long-distance dance battle. You're going to be trading dance moves. You will start, then Joe will respond, then you will respond, and so on. Your first move can be really subtle, maybe just nodding your head or something. Make your move and then point at Joe so he knows it's his turn. You'll go back and forth like that.
				 </section>
				 <section>
					<h2>Endgame</h2>
					I hope you had fun. You can find Joe in the hall to your right (his left) and the adventure will continue beyond this tour.
