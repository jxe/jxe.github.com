  <p>
    I'm a philosopher, sociologist, game designer, and entrepreneur.
  </p>
  <p>
    My biggest contribution is a definition of "human values", “meaningful living”, etc that's
    precise enough to create surveys, metrics, aligned ML models, etc. The same definition of values can enable
    explainable moral learning in AI. It can also be used to design systems that support meaningful living, bypassing
    the problems that happen when mechanisms like markets, ML, or social media optimize for engagement and revealed
    preference.
  </p>

  <p>
    This work is a formalization of definitions of values from Ruth Chang, Charles Taylor, and others.
  </p>

  <p>
    I run <a href="https://sfsd.io">an online school</a>, where I wrote <a href="https://textbook.sfsd.io/">a textbook
      on Values-Based Design</a>. I'm currently starting <a href="https://rebuildingmeaning.org">a nonprofit</a> to
    bring about a future where wise AIs and humans collaborate
    to help people live well.

  <b>Background</b>
</div>

<article>
  <p>
    I got started by developing the meaning-based organizational metrics at Couchsurfing.com, then co-founded
    the Center for Humane Technology with Tristan Harris, and coined the term “Time Well Spent” for a family of metrics
    adopted by teams at Facebook, Google, and Apple.
  </p>

  <p>I then started <a href="https://sfsd.io">an online school</a> and
    wrote <a href="https://textbook.sfsd.io/">a textbook on Values-Based Design</a>, and more recently am starting <a
      href="https://rebuildingmeaning.org">a nonprofit</a> to bring about a future where wise AIs and humans collaborate
    to help people live well.
  </p>

  <p>
    My philosophy work descends clearly from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen">Amartya Sen</a>, <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Taylor_(philosopher)">Charles Taylor</a>, <a
      href="http://nyu.academia.edu/DavidVelleman/">David Velleman</a>, and <a href="http://ruthchang.net/">Ruth
      Chang</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In tech, I was lucky to learn from people like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a>, <a
      href="https://hci.stanford.edu/winograd/">Terry Winograd</a>, and <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Verplank">Bill Verplank</a> at <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_Research_Corporation">Interval Research</a>, from <a
      href="http://www.caseyfenton.com/">Casey Fenton</a> at CouchSurfing (where I developed the <a
      href="/csmetrics/">metrics</a> which guided the company), from <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/hes/">Howie
      Shrobe</a> and <a href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/">Marvin Minksy</a> at MIT. And more recently through
    conversations with <a href="http://worrydream.com">Bret Victor</a> and <a href="http://rmozone.com/">Rob
      Ochshorn</a>.
  </p>

  <p>My tactic of running social experiments through games and performance emerged from study with <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Wolff_(composer)">Christian Wolff</a> (partipatory music) and <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Parnell">Peter Parnell</a> (playwriting) at Dartmouth, and then various
    improvisational scores with <a href="http://nancystarksmith.com/">Nancy Stark Smith</a>, <a
      href="http://www.mikevargas.net/">Mike Vargas</a>, <a href="http://www.actiontheater.com/ruth.htm">Ruth

    on the real world games festival <a href="http://www.comeoutandplay.org/">Come Out and Play</a>.</p>

  <p>Finally, I've benefited from conversations with <a href="http://www.tristanharris.com/">Tristan Harris</a>, <a
      href="https://twitter.com/ellie__hain">Ellie Hain</a>, Nathan Vanderpool, and Anne Selke. </p>

## Earlier work



### <a id="conning"></a> Conning People Out of Their Habits <span vous="discuss"></span>

When people discuss the evenings, days, and weeks that make life worth living, they talk about experiences of connection, wonder, teamwork, adventure, etc.  We miss out on opportunities for experiences like these for all kinds of social, economic, and personal reasons.  Our pedestrian and experiential habits form an important class of these obstacles.  A simple way to intervene is to understand the personal habits of navigation and the social codes around navigation (both navigation of architectural/public space and navigation of time options, more generally) that keep people from otherwise-available experiences they would review highly, and to learn to conn people out of these habits.

We use techniques from conn artistry, theme park design, game design, mythmaking, and immersive theatre to interfere with these habits and social codes.



### <a id="coord"></a> Environments for Describing &amp; Coordinating Group Work <span vous="discuss"></span>

Increasingly the expressive intent of artists and programmers involves connecting people in new ways and coordinating new forms of action. While languages that treat connections and coordination in the core semantics have started to appear (my own CEML, and Sep's Dog), the field is young and we are not yet in a place where an amateur can concoct new media with new interactional modes and/or new social forms of action without a great deal of forethought.

* Software: [Groundcrew](#groundcrew), [CEML](#ceml), [LibDeck](#libdeck)
* Games: [Card Parties](#cardparties)


### <a id="connection"></a> Social Software as a Playground for Teamwork and Connection with Strangers <span vous="discuss"</span>

Under what circumstances do strangers come together quickly, either to work together or to share in various kinds of rapport and social interaction?  Answering this question has involved work with [couchsurfing](http://couchsurfing.org) on trust, search, and priming, with disaster relief organizations [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Communities) [2](#groundcrew), and with games and social art projects at various scales.

Work at CouchSurfing was especially valuable: we could live-test different preparations and funnels for strangers meeting one another.  We had opportunities to tune profiles (including review copy via review prompts), to tune search and matchmaking algorithms, and to tune the preparatory messages we send to both sides of a homestay before they meet up in person.  The reviews that users post are stories they tell about their experiences, and this gave us wonderful and rapid feedback about our changes.

**Learned**: there are many ways to prepare strangers so as to increase trust, openness, etc.  Tricks like double opt-ins, prompting welcome messages from peers, structuring interactions through a shared experience or task, and a careful ramp-up of intimacy can make 10-100x differences in conversions to positive and connected experiences.

## Past work

### Environments for Describing &amp; Coordinating Group Work

While most apps and websites are about coordinating social experiences, we're still coding at the level of individual experience.

We have made [a programming language for describing and deploying group interactions directly](#ceml), [a map-based real-time tool](#groundcrew) for coordinating group work, [a JSON format and JavaScript library](#libdeck) for working with multiplayer tasks, and more. I am presently working on a more playful format for authoring and deploying group interactions:  a website for appreciating songs as a group called pressplayground. [read more](#coord)


## <a id="tentative"></a> Odds and Ends

* There might be a better way to do [economics 101](https://hackpad.com/Lets-Modernize-Econ-101-YHCWZmsRMpc)


### <a id="lwl"></a> Microeconomics Evaluated in Playground Terms <span vous="discuss"></span>

What are the most fulfilling things that can happen to a person in an evening or a day?  An emotional breakthrough, a breathtaking vista, a playful conversation with a loved one, the resolution of a longstanding logistical or material problem, a return to an aspect of oneself...

The market for these fulfilling experiences is unusual in that provisioning experiences requires unusual insight into and influence over personality and state, and the criteria for consumer search are poorly understood by both consumers and providers.  These goods are all either experience goods or credence goods which means they cannot be selected from a catalogue.

It is instructive to create situations where there are many providers of potentially fullfilling experiences and many consumers, and various attempts to coordinate can be studied and engineered.

**Learned:** There is a certain regularity to the things that emerge as frequently fulfilling in these environments.  [Diagram of Desires and Rapports](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qlreore5l5rixmx/desires-and-rapports.pdf).  There is also regularity to the information we need about a person in order to address interactions and rapports they will engage in to them, and regularity to the ways that "vendors" of interaction and rapport need to present themselves in order to be browsable and engagable.





### <a id="lifestyle"></a> Dynamics of Lifestyle Change <span vous="discuss"</span>

An individual's pattern of consumption, production, and time allocation can change dramatically as a result of life events (graduation from HS or college, moving to a city), shifts in affiliation (marriage, divorce, club memberships, new friends), and personal realizations. Although motivating lifestyle change is key to addressing major problems like carbon emissions, obesity, and poverty, little is understood about the conditions that produce positive lifestyle change and how to engineer more of them. We can use activity and event attendance, social graph, and location data to track lifestyle change in a global population and offer suggestions for encouraging certain changes globally.

At couchsurfing we observed that users tended to change lifestyle as their affiliations changed.  And others have noted that who we affiliate with [is the major factor in determining lifestyle](http://www.ted.com/talks/nicholas_christakis_the_hidden_influence_of_social_networks.html).  This led me to question whether it might be possible to migrate people to new, more fulfilling lifestyles using the social graph and activity search.

If social activity search and activity recommenders have the potential to change lifestyles dramatically, we can ask ourselves how we're doing on that front on the internet, and how we could do better.

Users of facebook newsfeed say yes to more than 200 million person-hours of activities recommended by newsfeed each day.  Anecdotally, in a casual survey, we observe that users tend to regret accepting those recommendations when the last week of activity is summarized in front of them.  This is a far cry from a migration to a life well lived.
