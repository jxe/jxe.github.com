== Risk-reduction strategies for CouchSurfing ==

We are working on a unified [[:wikipedia:trust metric|trust metric]] for CouchSurfing, supplanting the several systems (friend links, references, vouching) currently in use, and providing a single, quantitative assessment of a users' trustworthiness, and our degree of confidence about that trustworthiness.

== Desired attributes ==

== Proposals ==

One proposed calculation is at [[TrustRating]].

Another is in [[Image:CS_Score.xls|this spreadsheet]].
