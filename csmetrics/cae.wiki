We coin the term '''adventure economy''' to refer to a ''[[:wikipedia:gift economy|gift economy]]'' that is ''[[pay-forward]]'', ''in-person'', ''global'' and ''among strangers''.  In any economy, there are challenges in allocating resources effectively and avoiding abuse, but these are of special concern in non-market economies among strangers, where we don't have the information mechanisms of [[:wikipedia:Free price system|the price system]] ([http://www.britannica.com/nobel/macro/5001_98_11.html], [http://jim.com/econ/chap15p2.html]) nor of [[:wikipedia:social relations|social relations]], and we are also missing the risk-reduction mechanisms of [[:wikipedia:contracts|contracts]].  In this group we develop the allocation and risk-reduction mechanisms for [[CouchSurfing]], an adventure economy.

== Basics ==
* The Presentation: [[The Future of Work, Fun, and Being Social]]. Slides by [[Joe Edelman]]
* Backgrounder: [[Motivations for a non-market, pay-it-forward global system]] by [[Joe Edelman]]
* Getting involved:
** http://couchsurfing.com/group.html?gid=4350 (on couchsurfing)
** http://groups.google.com/group/adventure-economics (on google groups)

== Initiatives ==
* The [[Adventure Economy Portal]]: building a gateway for those who wish to participate in the adventure economy
* [[Trust API]]: providing a standard way for sites featuring trust and references to export those so that a persons trustworthiness can be evaluated in other projects
* [[Opportunity API]]: providing standard search and aggregation mechanisms for (person, place, time, activity) tuples
* [[Adventure econometrics]]: measuring the health of adventure economies
* [[Random Action]]: a proposed companion site to couchsurfing that's all about [[random acts of kindness]], and [[raokserver]], the software that will run the site and provide add'l features for CouchSurfing as well

== CouchSurfing-specific Groups ==
* [[Trust and reputation]]: risk-reduction strategies for CouchSurfing
* [[Efficient allocation of hospitality experiences]] (i.e. ''the CouchRank algorithm'')
* [[Free life]]: extending the systems we develop to other economic activity

== Conferences to attend ==
