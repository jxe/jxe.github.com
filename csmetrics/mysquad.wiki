MySquad - welcome to the Adventure Economy

* a short English abstract of 50 to 100 words. The abstracts should be provided as plain text, and not as file attachments. This abstract will be used as public description of your submission in the conference program

We coin the '''adventure economy''' to refer to a gift economy that is pay-forward, in-person, global and among strangers. In any economy, there are challenges in allocating resources effectively and avoiding abuse, but these are of special concern in non-market economies among strangers, where we don't have the information mechanisms of the price system nor of social relations, and we are also missing the risk-reduction mechanisms of contracts. '''MySquad''' is a first step towards the realization of the Adventure Economy.

* a detailed description (or full paper) of at least one page (300 words or more). This description will not be published unless you want it, but used for reviewing your submission.

You may use any language, but we strongly suggest English or Chinese. Full descriptions may include a link to a full paper or slides in HTML or PDF, if available.

Now, imagine a real-world geolocative issue tracking system, where people can report material/immaterial needs and excesses via txt and GPS, imagine an army of on-the-ground agents, delivery and pickup people, do-gooders, imagine a (smaller) army of dispatchers, on the web, looking at issues reported in real-time and dispatching instructions/assignment to do-gooder agents.
You're on the street, you txt "+burrito +30m L:mission and 30th", that means you have 30 minutes available and an extra burrito. You get an assignment, you deliver the burrito. Maneki Neko (Bruce Sterling, 1999), only with real people dispatching instead of "AI"s.
